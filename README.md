(Part of) my resume written as a readable and compilable OCaml file. Inspired by https://gist.github.com/klange/4042963.
I'm a TA at the University of Pennsylvania for our second level CS course (which uses OCaml) so when I saw klange's gist I thought it would be fun to do the same with OCaml.

How to run the file:
First make sure you have ocaml installed (You can install it [here](ocaml-4.01.0-intel.dmg)).
Then just download the repo and run:


```
$ ocamlc -o resume resume.ml
$ ./resume
```

That's it! The resume will print to the console.
